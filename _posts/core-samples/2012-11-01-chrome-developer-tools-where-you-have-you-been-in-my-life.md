<p>
  I remember the first time someone told me that I should be using Chrome Developer tools, or Firebug, or some variation thereof in the browser to help with my front-end coding.
</p>

<p>
  I didn&#8217;t get it.
</p>

<p>
  Now I can&#8217;t live without it! Because, you see, view:source is only helpful to a certain extent. When I&#8217;m coding an HTML/CSS/Javascript template, and the jQuery isn&#8217;t working, for example, I&#8217;ll hit option-command-J, and it&#8217;ll show me the exact line in the javascript file where the error is occurring. Click on &#8220;Elements&#8221; within Chrome Developer Tools, and I&#8217;ll be able to see height and width dimensions for elements on the page.
</p>

<p>
  Once upon a time, I remember feeling at a loss about the hex code of a background color of an element I was trying to replicate. Now, it&#8217;s simple: open Chrome Developer Tools, perhaps click on the element with the inspector tool, and look at the CSS.
