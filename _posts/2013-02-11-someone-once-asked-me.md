I don&#8217;t think so; it&#8217;s more that I have an &#8220;I have so many ideas for cool things that great design + web interactivity can do to help bring people together in a shared marketplace&#8221; bug, but I end up just spending most of the time frowning at my laptop because of a) code or installation bugs; or b) because I don&#8217;t have version control or ssh set up for my personal projects yet. Argh. But that is changing pretty soon!
