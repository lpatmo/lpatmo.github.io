  I just caught the tail end of <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/tech/ground-supertower.html">Ground Zero Supertower</a>, a NOVA documentary that aired on 9/11/2013, and am quite amazed by the level of money, effort, dangerous + heavy machinery, and risks that thousands poured into building the new skyscraper, memorial and museum. With the transport and mechanical costs (think: mixtures fried in 3000 fahrenheit temperatures to create heavy glass, then transported a few thousand miles away) needed to create the monuments, I&#8217;m reminded by how hardcore engineering seems so much more *difficult* than software engineering.

  Human invention (including the cameras and editing techniques and software that led to the production of the well-shot documentary I watched) is amazing&#8230; yes, we are still so easily susceptible to car accidents and fires and bullets, <strong>but let&#8217;s never forget the power that people have built </strong>by taking the pieces of collective accumulated knowledge and working together**.

  **Also why I love hackathons, but that&#8217;s another story.
