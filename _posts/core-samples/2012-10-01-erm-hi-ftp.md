  I can&#8217;t believe it took me this long to figure out how to connect to my Bluehost account in FileZilla.
</p>

<p>
  But yes, here are the easy instructions:Â https://box363.bluehost.com:2083/frontend/bluehost/ftp/accounts.html
</p>

<p>
  Y&#8217;know, I think the only reason I haven&#8217;t done this sooner is because I had been in the very terrible habit of editing files directly in my bluehost or WP accounts. I&#8217;d never watched someone go through all the steps of working on files saved locally /before/ committing them to the site until very recently, when I sat in on a hands-on WordPress development workshop. I learned so many small but useful things in that class! It definitely deserves its own post at some point.
</p>

<p>
  Anyway, lesson learned: not everyone uses git or subversion to commit files to their sites.
