  &#8230; and I say &#8220;the hard way&#8221; because I suddenly need to know it for <em>work</em> work.
</p>

<p>
  I think the last time I went through Zed Shaw&#8217;s <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/" target="_blank">Learn Python the Hard Way</a> I stopped around exercise 15 or 16. At that time, I had no real incentive to learn Python other than for personal interest, though. This time the need is real!

  Bring it on. :-)
