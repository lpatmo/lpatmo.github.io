  It occurred to me, recently, how satisfying learning how to develop for the web could be. Sure, there are the frustrations when you type in a few lines of code and something that should work <em>doesn&#8217;t</em>, but once you spend enough time staring at the screen (or double-checking all the lines you know you were supposed to include, or dragging in a third party for help), there&#8217;s a good chance that you&#8217;ll eventually figure it out. And at that point, the feeling is magnificent.
</p>

<p>
  Because <em>it&#8217;ll be working</em>. And if it&#8217;s been deployed to a live site, you can always send the URL to someone to show it off.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>Me:</em> Check this out!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>Friend:</em> All I see is a button, and all it does is change colors when my mouse hovers over it. I don&#8217;t even know what the button does.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>Me:</em> I know! Isn&#8217;t that so cool?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>Friend:</em> &#8230;
  </p>
</blockquote>

  Successfully troubleshooting code for the web reminds me of the satisfaction I used to feel in eighth grade when I successfully applied a new concept to a slightly tricky algebra problem. But it&#8217;s even better because whereas the final answer to an algebra problem is kind of useless, the final answer to a web development problem has several possible real-world implications.
</p>

<p>
  For example: 
  
  <div class="steps">
    <strong>Possible Implication #1:</strong> Your website will be prettier.
  </div>
  
  <div class="steps">
    <strong>Possible Implication #2:</strong> Your website will be so pretty that it&#8217;ll increase email subscription rates by 105% (the previous conversion rate, when your website wasn&#8217;t so user-friendly, was 1%).
  </div>
  
  <div class="steps">
    <strong>Possible Implication #3:</strong>: Your pretty, user-friendly, A/B tested website happens to be supporting scholarship grants for girls who would otherwise lack access to an education. You send out a donation ask to your 1000 new subscribers, and .5% converts. The 5 people who send you checks give enough to support the scholarships of three girls. One of them grows up to be a doctor. <s>You save</s> She happens to be at the right time and place to save the life of an infant. <del datetims="2012-01-01T19:28:47+00:00">You save</del> The infant grows up to be a superhero who saves the world.
