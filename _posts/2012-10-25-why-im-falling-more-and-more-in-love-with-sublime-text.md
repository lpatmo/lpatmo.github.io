<p>
  Over the past week I&#8217;ve discovered that not only can I copy the file path of my document by right-clicking and selecting &#8220;copy file path&#8221; in <a href=&#8221;http://www.sublimetext.com/&#8221; target=&#8221;_blank&#8221;>Sublime Text</a>, the text editor also allows me to short-handedly insert a comment by typing command-/ on the mac.
</p>

<p>
  In other words, instead of typing out <!&#8211;comment&#8211;> in HTML or /*Comment*/ in CSS, I&#8217;d just have to press two keys!
</p>

<p>
  And instead of trying to memorize file paths when I commit files, all I&#8217;d have to do is right-click-copy!
</p>

<p>
  Hurrah for small, seconds-saving victories.
