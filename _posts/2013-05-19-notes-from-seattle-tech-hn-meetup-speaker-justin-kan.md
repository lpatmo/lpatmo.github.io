  <strong>Justin Kan</strong>, of justin.tv fame, stopped by the <a href="http://www.zillow.com/">Zillow offices</a> to give a short presentation about the many ideas he and his co-founders entertained before they landed on the &#8220;right&#8221; product &#8212; that is, something that had market value and market traction.
</p>

<p>
  Justin gave a nod to the story of how <a href="http://www.bullfax.com/?q=node-meet-ceo-who-lived-taco-bell-parking-lot-and-now-runs-c">three entrepreneurs from Japan</a> turned Mieple &#8212; initially an online dating site &#8212; into <a href="https://anyperk.com/">Anyperk</a>, a service that provides employees with travel, entertainment, fitness, and telecom discounts.
</p>

<p>
  And then he talked about the projects that he and his team personally pivoted on &#8212; from Kieko (YC 2005), which turned into SocialCam, which turned into <a href="http://www.justin.tv/">justin.tv</a>, which turned into <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/">Twitch</a>, a video platform for gamers who want to watch other gamers in play. Now he&#8217;s working on <a href="https://iamexec.com/">Exec</a>, an online booking service that hires cleaners.
</p>

<p>
  The summary of the presentation?
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Don&#8217;t be afraid to pivot.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  I should probably mention that I had no idea Justin (just like <a href="http://grist.org/list/macklemore-credits-seattles-park-system-with-launching-his-rap-career/#.UZePE1eoZs4.twitter">Macklemore</a>, I found out recently!) originally hailed from Seattle until I read the introductory text on the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/HackerNewsSeattleMeetup/events/115959022/">Hacker News meetup page</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I also got the chance to meet a couple of cool people, including two freelancers, a Starbucks developer, and an Amazon developer. Half of them grew up in Seattle. Way to represent!
</p>

<p>
  This meetup is just another plus that endears me to Seattle.
