<p>
  On mac, type in:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    file:///Users/YOUR_USERNAME/folder/wherever/you/saved/your/file.html
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  I also learned that typing &#8220;../&#8221; moves up a directory from the level you&#8217;re currently at. For example, if an image called &#8220;cat.jpg&#8221; was saved in a folder whose root folder was above a level from the document that you&#8217;re working in, typing in &#8220;../&#8221; moves you up to the level of the root folder. Then all you would need to do is type in the path where cat.jpg was saved. Here&#8217;s another example in practice:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <img src=&#8221;../rootfolder/animals/cats/cat.jpg&#8221; />
  </li>
</ul></span>
