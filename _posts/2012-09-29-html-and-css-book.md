<p>
  A couple of weeks ago I found a copy of <a href="http://htmlandcssbook.com/" target="_blank">The HTML and CSS book</a> in my bookstore. It looked very visual, so I started flipping through it &#8212; and before I knew it, three and a half hours had passed and I had read/skimmed through the entire 490-page book.
</p>

<p>
  I promptly bought it for a couple of reasons:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    It&#8217;s very pretty!
  </li>
  <li>
    I could see myself using it as a reference book. What I&#8217;d learned about HTML and CSS thus far had mostly come from googling occasional articles and reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/CSS-Missing-David-Sawyer-McFarland/dp/0596802447">CSS: The Missing Manual</a>,Â by David Sawyer McFarland, on my ipad. My e-version is great, and goes into a lot of detail, but doesn&#8217;t quite make it as a handy reference guide.
  </li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>
  I was happy with the fact that although much of what I was reading was already familiar, there were small details that filled the gaps of my knowledge. And the book was organized in such a way that the placement of each chapter (color-coded!) made total sense.
</p>

<p>
  I lied: I actually ended up buying two copies &#8212; one for myself, and another for my boyfriend who had expressed some desire in learning web design.
