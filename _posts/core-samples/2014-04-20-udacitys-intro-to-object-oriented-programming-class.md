<p>
  Udacity just launched an intro to object-oriented programming class using python (as always), and I am super excited! I&#8217;d already gone through some of its <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs101" target="_blank">Intro to Computer Science</a> and <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs253" target="_blank">Web Development</a> curriculum. What I really like about the videos is that they stop occasionally to quiz you. In addition, they give you exercises and homework assignments to submit, and forums to go to if you have a question.

  I&#8217;ll have a more complete review about this series after I complete more than just the first few chapters.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>UPDATE:Â </strong>I finished! Took me about a week and a half to go through. I&#8217;ll have a more thorough review of the course up later.
