<p>
  W3 Validator &#8212; <a href="http://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">http://validator.w3.org/</a> &#8212; has been a lifesaver on a few separate occasions for me within the past year. It&#8217;s been particularly helpful when:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    I had no idea why my layout suddenly looked horrible in older versions of IE. (Hint: missing divs obfuscated by the server-side code!)
  </li>
  <li>
    Links &#8212; yet again in older versions of IE &#8212; suddenly stopped working. (Hint: wrapping <a> tags around <button> elements is actually not valid.)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  &#8230; so yeah, I now make it a habit of running my code through the validator just in case I missed something. Markup issues seem so easy to fix on the surface, but the validator can help a lot when you have a *lot* of nested tags.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Process note: </strong>The default page on the validator shows you an input box where you need to put in a URL, but you can  also validate your code via file upload or &#8220;direct input&#8221;. That is, if your markup isn&#8217;t being hosted at a public URL, you can simply view:source and copy/paste your code into the text box that appears under the &#8220;direct input&#8221; tab.
