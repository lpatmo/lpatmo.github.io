  Just discovered <a href="https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans" target="_blank">https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans</a> by way of someone who proposed a <a href="http://hangouts.codebuddies.org/posts/igZTy45aYYE9fKGtR" target="_blank">CodeBuddies hangout</a> on this tonight.
</p>

<p>
  It&#8217;s a terminal &#8220;game&#8221; that you run while editing files to make the tests pass and it&#8217;s surprisingly fun/a good review.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Steps for getting started:</strong><br /> 1. git clone https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans.git<br /> 2. cd python_koans/python2<br /> 3. Run <code>python contemplate_koans.py</code> in the terminal.<br /> 4. The terminal will tell you which file in python_koans/python2/koans to open up and edit. Edit the line and then run python contemplate_koans.py in the terminal again to make it pass, at which point you&#8217;ll be pointed to the next error to fix.

<p>
  SURPRISINGLY ADDICTIVE!

  I recently had a coffee chat with <a href="http://twitter.com/saronyitbarek" target="_blank">@saronyitbarek</a>, who swore by TDD, and a lot of what she told me made sense &#8212; i.e. the idea of outlining your steps before you start to code. We&#8217;d just installed <a href="https://github.com/django-nose/django-nose" target="_blank">nose</a> at work too, so I plan to try to get into the habit of it too.
