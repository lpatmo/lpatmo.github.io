  The interesting message that I took away? <em>Relationships matter.</em> That is, people will always be looking for clues surrounding the information presented. The number &#8220;5&#8221;, for example, is huge when placed next to a &#8220;3&#8221;, but tiny when placed next to &#8220;1000.&#8221;

  That exactly wasn&#8217;t an example Idan used, but rather my over-simplification of an idea that provoked me the most.
