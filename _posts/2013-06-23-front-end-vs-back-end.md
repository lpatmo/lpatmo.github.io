<p>
  Are some people more naturally suited to being front-end developers versus back-end developers, or vice versa?
</p>

<p>
  My understanding of front-end development (which I love) is that it&#8217;s useful to have a good understanding of the back-end technologies. I haven&#8217;t done enough back-end work to discuss whether I like it or not&#8230; but I&#8217;ve talked to a couple of people by now who&#8217;ve said that they&#8217;re die-hard back-end developers who hate doing front-end work.
