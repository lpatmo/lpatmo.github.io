<p>
  Find a study partner.
</p>

<p>
  Your partner should be a friend or significant other, not a competitor.
</p>

<p>
  Read through an entire book or tutorial together. Work through the parts you each get stuck on &#8212; the parts that would&#8217;ve discouraged you or driven you to distraction had you been studying the material by yourself.
</p>

<p>
  Schedule an hour every day to work on the material in tandem. Don&#8217;t skip ahead; don&#8217;t let your partner skip ahead.
</p>

<p>
  If you can&#8217;t meet in person, talk on skype and use Skype&#8217;s free screenshare feature in turns so that one or the other can &#8220;drive&#8221; the code.
</p>

<p>
  Make sure you both type out any code passages in the book/tutorial. Complete the exercises. Ask questions about the same passages. Quiz each other on whether you can explain new concepts.
</p>

<p>
  If something doesn&#8217;t make sense, find external help. Start typing out questions on stackoverflow, and realize 90% of the way through that you already knew the answer. Use each of your respective googling skills. Find someone to take a look at your question at a programming meetup if all else fails.
</p>

<p>
  Talk out loud. Constantly ask each other questions. Program individually, and then review each other&#8217;s code.
</p>

<p>
  Make it a habit.Â Do this an hour a day.
