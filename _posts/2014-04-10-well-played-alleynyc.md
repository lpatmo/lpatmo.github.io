  Early last year, some of <a href="http://www.meetup.com/codecrewny/" target="_blank">my</a> <a href="http://www.meetup.com/hackerhours/" target="_blank">favorite</a> <a href="http://www.meetup.com/nycpython/" target="_blank">casual</a> NYC tech meetups were meeting in coffee shops and the New York Public Library on the weekends. Then, suddenly, I was getting e-mails from <em>all three meetups </em>about a free new venue on Sunday afternoons &#8212; at a co-working place called <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/AlleyNYC/@40.75313,-73.989527,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x89c2511bf60bc5a9:0xb3062668f38c06a6" target="_blank">AlleyNYC</a>, right under Times Square and to the west of Bryant Park.
</p>

<p>
  In my opinion, it was <em>excellent</em> marketing for the space.
</p>

<p>
  Turns out AlleyNYC also hosts weekend hackathons and other meetups that require eventbrite ticket purchases to attend, but <em>generally</em> on Sunday afternoons, the space is wide open for anyone to bring their laptop over to hack and chat.

  A quiet late Sunday afternoon:

<p>
  When I have the opportunity to go, I&#8217;ve tended to meet a lot of cool people here, and exchanged much knowledge and tips. The audience tends to be a wide mix of beginners learning to code, startup entrepreneurs working on their apps, and seasoned developers who go to be social and to help others.
</p>

<p>
  Sharing economy, indeed.
