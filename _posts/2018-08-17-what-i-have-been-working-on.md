Whelp, this blog (The Coding Diaries) hasn't been updated in *three* years! I've started chronicling some code notes on [codenotes.tumblr.com](http://codenotes.tumblr.com), which
you can follow if you are so inclined.

I am still a developer at [ActionKit](http://actionkit.com),
campaigning software for large progressive non-profits like MoveOn.org, Indivisible, ONE, the ACLU, and 350.org. I know a bit more than front-end (Python, Django, SQL) now.

In my free time, I've been growing a global community of independent code learners who enjoy sharing knowledge
and helping each other become better software developers, called [CodeBuddies](http://codebuddies.org). The project is [open-sourced](https://github.com/codebuddies/codebuddies) and also has an [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/codebuddies).

It's a great community full of amazing contributors; more about them [here](http://codebuddies.org/about).
 Join us on the Slack or on the [forum](http://forum.codebuddies.org), too; I'm `@linda` there.
