<p>
  I remember the first time someone wrote a short piece of code in front of me that output one string of text when it was a certain time of day, and another string of text when it was another time of day. I thought it was magic. How did he know what to write?

  Nine months later, now that I&#8217;ve scratched the surface a little, I understand that most of it is syntax &#8212; knowing what works, what doesn&#8217;t. Every snippet has a starting bracket and an ending part; there are certain concepts (such as if/then statements) that will probably work in a couple of different derivative languages.Â I&#8217;m still picking up pieces here and there, but I think it&#8217;s time to get serious by opening up a few textbooks. I&#8217;m pretty happy to have access to Safari Books Online.
