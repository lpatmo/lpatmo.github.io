  Some people think that volunteering requires a lot of effort. You apply to a program; they accept you; you train for a few hours, and then you commit to volunteering a couple of hours every week.
</p>

<p>
  In my opinion, though, volunteering in a city like NYC &#8212; with its large and ever-growing tech community &#8211; doesn&#8217;t need to be so difficult. If you identify as a developer, or if you&#8217;re even just <em>learning</em> to code, you don&#8217;t need to look too far to engage.

<p>
  Below is a list of my favorite spaces to &#8220;volunteer&#8221; with (in no order of preference) in NYC.

  In general, my philosophy is that volunteering is about being<em> present</em>. You volunteer by going to a meetup and asking thoughtful questions. You volunteer by helping a stranger solve a technical problem that they were struggling with. You volunteer by exchanging advice and resource tips with the team you work with at a hackathon. You volunteer by talking to newbies about your own learning path as a developer.
</p>

<p>
  Often, what you&#8217;ll come to find is that in the act of &#8220;volunteering,&#8221; you learn a lot too. New friends give you professional or technical advice. New mentors help you when it&#8217;sÂ <em>your</em> turn to get stuck on a new framework you&#8217;ve been learning for your personal project. You serendipitously discover a lot of free stickers you can put on your laptop.
