  This is a pretty cool presentation demo-ing AngularJS + Firebase, an API to store and sync data in real-time. The presenter creates an asynchronous commenting web app (think: youtube comments that refresh by themselves!) using only a couple lines of javascript.

  I first heard about Firebase this weekend when I saw a javascript developer get up a NodeJS real-time chat web app within a couple of hours. Glad I heard about it then; else I wouldn&#8217;t have clicked on the link in my twitter feed to this video.
