 Welp, this blog (The Coding Diaries) hasn't been updated in *three* years! I've started chronicling some code notes on [codenotes.tumblr.com](http://codenotes.tumblr.com), which
you can follow if you are so inclined. 

 Yep, I am still a developer at [ActionKit](http://actionkit.com), 
campaigning software for large progressive non-profits like MoveOn.org, Indivisible, ONE, the ACLU, and 350.org. Know a bit
more than front-end (Python, Django, SQL) now. 

 And in my spare time, I've been growing an open-sourced online community of independent code learners who enjoy sharing knowledge
and helping each other become better software developers, called [CodeBuddies](http://codebuddies.org).

It's a great community and non-profit passion project and you can learn more about it [here](http://codebuddies.org/about).
 Join us on the Slack or on the [forum](http://forum.codebuddies.org), too; I'm `@linda` there.
