<p>
  This time last year, I was hesitant to call myself a front-end developer. What&#8217;s changed?
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Using the terminal and using version control (github or SVN) doesn&#8217;t scare me.
  </li>
  <li>
    I don&#8217;t get stuck on basic jQuery errors (update: and I can help co-workers with jQuery problems!).
  </li>
  <li>
    I understand when to use if/else statements and for loops better.
  </li>
  <li>
    I know how to organize my html/css/javascript files and preview a website in my local browser.
  </li>
  <li>
    I use stackoverflow.
  </li>
  <li>
    I know how to FTP my files to a server, and how to push small projects to Heroku.
  </li>
  <li>
    I use the W3 validator and JSlint to validate my html and javascript.
  </li>
  <li>
    I use LESS and Twitter Bootstrap.
  </li>
  <li>
    I&#8217;ve been to six hackathons, and made friends working in tech
  </li>
  <li>
    I&#8217;ve realized that compared to some folks I&#8217;ve met with actual CS degrees, I&#8217;m pretty good at CSS
  </li>
  <li>
    I&#8217;ve had a lot of practice applying responsive design on almost all of my projects.
  </li>
  <li>
    I got over my confusion about how to use APIs at all, and used the Google Maps API, Tumblr API, and Flickr APIs on some projects for the first time.
  </li>
  <li>
    I&#8217;ve become a lot better at debugging problems, and knowing when to ask for help
  </li>
  <li>
    Learning new frameworks or languages has become easier because of the knowledge foundation I&#8217;ve built so far.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  That said, there&#8217;s still a lot more to learn. AngularJS looks formidable. Writing complicated SQL still scares me. I&#8217;ve never had to create tables in production before. I haven&#8217;t looked into noSQL (mongoDB, etc.) much. I haven&#8217;t looked at CS50x, Harvard&#8217;s free intro to CS course. I suspect I need more practice writing modular javascript. I know just enough to apply front-end changes to a Ruby on Rails app, but I haven&#8217;t taken the leap to really understanding Rails.
</p>

<p>
  To be honest, I&#8217;m pretty curious about what this entry will look next year. As long as I continue to enjoy learning web development (and blogging about it), there&#8217;s hope yet, I think.
