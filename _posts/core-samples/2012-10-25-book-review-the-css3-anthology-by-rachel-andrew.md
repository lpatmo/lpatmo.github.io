  I flipped through this book in the same way that I flipped through the <a href="http://www.thecodingdiaries.com/html-and-css-book/" target="_blank">HTML & CSS book</a> I noted earlier &#8212; that is, from cover to cover.
</p>

<p>
  It. Is. Amazing. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/CSS3-Anthology-Take-Sites-Heights/dp/0987153021"><img src="http://www.thecodingdiaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/css3anthology-cover.jpg" alt="" title="The CSS3 Anthology" width="300" height="300" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-492" target="_blank" /></a>
</p>

<p>
  I thought the book was unique in its organization style; section titles are comprised of &#8220;How can I make this happen&#8221; <em>questions</em>, followed immediately by a summary of the solution, a code sample, and a discussion of the code.
</p>

<p>
  For those more experienced with CSS/CSS3, just glancing at the CSS code sample is a good enough review; for those less experienced, the few paragraphs of discussion text are enlightening.
</p>

<p>
  I was seriously pretty happy with this book; I felt like it answered all the questions I had when &#8212; especially in the early days &#8212; I had a lot of &#8220;How do I do this with CSS?&#8221; questions that I had to google to find the answers to.
</p>

<p>
  Yes, yes, everyone learns by googling &#8212; but this book is a pretty good compilation of the common questions that anyone who hasn&#8217;t had a formal course in CSS(3) would have, and would probably save the beginner a lot of time.
