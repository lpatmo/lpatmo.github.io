  There is just something about listening to people talk about a programming concept in person &#8212; or having to explain a programming concept to another person &#8212; that makes <em>mastering the material</em> a lot more fun, and the frustrations much easier to struggle through.
</p>

<p>
  Obviously the bulk of the learning comes during one&#8217;s own time &#8212; i.e. when you&#8217;re following a tutorial, or independently writing code. However, I&#8217;ve found that the simple act of going to tech meetups and talking about the web development experience with other people has been incredibly helpful in accelerating my learning. At these meetups, I&#8217;ve:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    debugged terminal/installation/language syntax problems with some slight guidance from more experienced developers;
  </li>
  <li>
    walked newbies through pushing and pulling from git, javascript, and Bootstrap CSS;
  </li>
  <li>
    solved a problem I got stuck with in the middle of doing a supplementary exercise in <a href="http://www.tangowithdjango.com/book/" target="_blank">Tango with Django</a> by using <a href="http://south.aeracode.org/" target="_blank">South</a>, thanks to some guidance from a more experienced Django developer;
  </li>
  <li>
    gotten recommendations for several good Python and Django tutorials, including <a href="http://pydanny.com/announcing-two-scoops-of-django-1.6.html" target="_blank">Two Scoops of Django</a>, Tango with Django, and <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ChristopherAdams5/epic-south-disasters" target="_blank">this slidedeck</a> about epic disasters with South;
  </li>
  <li>
    recommended <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/ud036" target="_blank">Udacity&#8217;s Intro to OOP</a> course to a lot of beginners struggling through Learn Python the Hard Way (Hi! Hope it&#8217;s been helpful!);
  </li>
  <li>
    reviewed basic python and OOP concepts in random conversation;
  </li>
  <li>
    realized that I knew a lot more about installing Django with virtualenv than I thought I did when I had to explain it to a Django beginner;
  </li>
  <li>
    reviewed Python fundamentals at two PyLadies meetups and got access to some <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/logston/talks/blob/master/2014-05-22_Python_for_Intermediates/2014-05-22PyLadiesIntermediate.ipynb" target="_blank">awesome slides</a>:
  </li>
  <li>
    forked a Jekyll blog and collected some really useful tips about developing in Jekyll (hello, SASS and Grunt and jekyll serve &#8211;watch commands!) as well as migrating from WordPress to Jekyll
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  I am grateful to all those who&#8217;ve shared help, tutorial tips, and &#8220;talked shop&#8221; with me. Below is a collage of some photos from these meetups.
