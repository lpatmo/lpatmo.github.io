  I just saw a pop-up on earbits.com that asked me to share the site on Facebook or Twitter. Instead of an X button on the top right-hand side, however, they placed a small line of gray text for me to click on that said &#8220;No thanks, you don&#8217;t deserve it.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
  The mean-spirited message gave me pause. I wanted to be nice. I impulsively clicked on the twitter button. Shared!
</p>

<p>
  It was a clever message.
