<p>
  I am still in the middle of learning Django.
</p>

<p>
  In retrospect, starting with the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/intro/tutorial01/" target="_blank">Official Django Tutorial</a> was a mistake. The tutorial jumps around too much, even in the first chapter; it&#8217;s possible to follow the instructions and get your app working, but it probably serves better as a case study rather than a beginner&#8217;s tutorial.
</p>

<p>
  Recently, I read Erin Parker&#8217;s story about <a href="http://blog.hackbrightacademy.com/2014/04/spitfire-athlete-boasts-two-technical-co-founders-erin-parker-nidhi-kulkarni/" target="_blank">how she learned to program in Ruby on Rails and Objective-C in pursuit of her entrepreneurial goals</a>, and it lifted me a little from my despair that learning Django was taking far longer than I thought it would. Okay, to be fair, I was sidelined a little by my attempts to get more comfortable with Python first. But Django still seemed scary. This was her advice:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Don’t be afraid to go through programming books many, many times! I went through the Michael Hartl Ruby on Rails tutorial 3 times before it finally clicked. [&#8230;] Don’t be afraid to repeat, repeat, repeat until you’re comfortable with something inside and out. It’s not that you’re not smart – it’s just that repetition is often what it takes.&#8221;
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  I&#8217;m happy to report that I just re-read <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/intro/tutorial01/" target="_blank">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/intro/tutorial01/</a> after finishing the exercises in <a href="http://www.tangowithdjango.com/book/chapters/setup.html" target="_blank">http://www.tangowithdjango.com/book/chapters/setup.html</a> and half of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5VlpgEVVg4&#038;list=PLxxA5z-8B2xk4szCgFmgonNcCboyNneMD" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5VlpgEVVg4&list=PLxxA5z-8B2xk4szCgFmgonNcCboyNneMD</a>, and the interactions between the models, views, urls.py and databases, and why <code>syncdb</code> is necessary makes a lot more sense! I can also see better all the ways the official tutorial jumped around, and in some ways got me to confuse the trees for the forest.
</p>

<p>
  Anyway, tldr: don&#8217;t give up. Revisit. Read carefully. Re-read.
