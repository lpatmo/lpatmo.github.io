  I was a windows user for&#8230; well, ever since I started using a computer. Then I got side-saddled with a mac. Then I looked up some mac keyboard shortcuts. Then I got used to the idea of typing &#8220;command&#8221;-key rather than &#8220;control&#8221;-key and FINALLY figured out that it was easier to press the &#8220;command&#8221; button with the thumb rather than with the pinkie.
</p>

<p>
  Then I started using all of these shortcuts:
</p>

<p>
  <strong>1) Taking a Screenshot</strong>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    shift-command-4
  </li>
</ul>

<div>
  <p>
    <strong>2) Opening up Chrome Developer Tools</strong>
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      option-command-j
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>
  <strong>3) Scrolling left, right, up, or down a page without the use of a mouse</strong>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    swipe with two fingers simultaneously on the mousepad!
  </li>
</ul>

<div>
  <p>
    <strong>4) Right-click</strong>
  </p>
  
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        hold down the &#8216;control&#8217; key (located right near the command key) while clickingÂ (okay, this was the only shortcut that took me an embarrassingly long while to figure out before I realized I could stop needing an external mouse&#8230;)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
  &#8230; Anyway, work on the computer has never been more fun now. The mac loads instantly in 2 seconds, whereas it took more than 30 seconds for my [admittedly kind-of-old PC] to load.
