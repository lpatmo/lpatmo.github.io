<p>
  Codeschool is the author of <a href=&#8221;http://tryruby.org&#8221; target=&#8221;_blank&#8221;>Try Ruby</a> and <a href=&#8221;http://try.github.com&#8221; target=&#8221;_blank&#8221;>Try Git</a>. I just watched the first video in their <a href=&#8221;http://www.codeschool.com/courses/jquery-air-first-flight&#8221; target=&#8221;_blank&#8221;>jQuery: First Flight</a> series, and attempted some of the follow-up exercises.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Verdict:</strong> I&#8217;m impressed! I like the polished look, the try-it-yourself exercises, the gamified set-up (you &#8220;earn&#8221; points for answering questions correctly and &#8220;spend&#8221; points on hints), and the fact that you can <a href=&#8221;http://courseware.codeschool.com.s3.amazonaws.com/jquery_air_slides.pdf&#8221; target=&#8221;_blank&#8221;>download the slides</a> from each video for reference as you complete the exercises.
</p>

<p>
  I&#8217;m not certain yet whether I&#8217;m up to paying the $25/month subscription fee for access to their other videos, though; maybe after I&#8217;ve completed their three free series, I&#8217;ll take a look at the other course offerings.

  Bonus: I think they mighty&#8217;ve gotten the pianist from <a href=&#8221;http://www.mertonshow.com/about&#8221; target=&#8221;_blank&#8221;>The Merton Show</a> or something to front all of their introductory videos. The intro songs are all hilarious.
