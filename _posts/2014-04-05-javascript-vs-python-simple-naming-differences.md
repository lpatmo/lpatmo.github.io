<p>
  I stumbled upon this 7-minute video about objects in Javascript on YouTube:
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
  While watching it, I realized how funny it was that similar-looking data types were called different things in different programming languages.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">example = &#91;1, 2, 3, 4&#93;</pre>

<p>
  In Javascript, this is called an array. In Python, it&#8217;s called a list.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">example = {
&#39;protagonist&#39;: &#39;Harry Potter&#39;,
&#39;nemesis&#39;: &#39;Voldemort&#39;,
&#39;antagonist&#39;: &#39;Draco Malfoy&#39;
}</pre>

<p>
  In Javascript, this is called an object. In Python, this is called a dictionary.
</p>

<p>
  If you&#8217;re switching from either language for the first time, don&#8217;t get tripped up!
