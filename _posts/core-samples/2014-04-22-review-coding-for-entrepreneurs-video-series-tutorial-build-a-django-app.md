  This tutorial took a couple of hours on Saturday afternoon and a couple of hours at Hacker Hours today, + 2 hours this evening to finish. All 21 videos were free, and you can start watching it here:

  My review: videos <strong>1-16</strong> were great, especially since the main part I was clueless about was working with models/views/controllers &#8212; so it was helpful seeing a couple of examples laid out step-by-step. I ran into trouble twice &#8212; once because I made a typo, and a second time because I missed that a tuple containing a single value still needed a comma (seriously).
</p>

<p>
  Although this (<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jmitchel3/coding-for-entrepreneurs">Kickstarter-backed!</a>) series purports to be aimed at entrepreneurs with &#8220;no background,&#8221; I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d recommend it to a complete beginner. Yes, it does a nice job summarizing simple command line and keyboard tricks as an acknowledgment to those who&#8217;ve never encountered the terminal, but I imagine some knowledge of python (so one can roughly understand what they&#8217;re typing) and html/css would significantly improve the experience.
</p>

<p>
  I was not a fan of <strong>17</strong>, <strong>18</strong>, and <strong>19</strong>, since for some reason the series decided to advertise paid hosting on webfaction.com and advocated manually dragging/dropping files via SFTP.
</p>

<p>
  There was also no mention of version control, or the fact that herokuapp technically allows free django app deployments from git&#8230; which would&#8217;ve been a great step to see.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>20</strong> was mostly about a simple copy/paste job of facebook/twitter plugin snippets. The series also relied heavily on bootstrap 3 to make its UI shiny, which I thought was a smart move, but I still can&#8217;t imagine anyone without at least *some* prior html/css knowledge going through this tutorial without a lot of questions.
</p>

<p>
  Summary: This ended being a pretty-good-start-to-but-not-entirely-comprehensive Django tutorial. I&#8217;m going to hit a textbook next.
