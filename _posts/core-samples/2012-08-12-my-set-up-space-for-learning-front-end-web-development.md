  <strong>Step One:</strong> Read book. I&#8217;m usually on an ipad with a Kindle purchase or with the Safari Books Online app, or on a tab in the Safari browser).

<p>
  <strong>Step Two:</strong> Type notes on web browser. I recently discovered an organization platform called <a href="http://www.workflowy.com" target="_blank">workflowy.com</a>, and I really like using it to organize <s>everything in my life</s> all the to-dos I have related to my personal projects. I find it useful for typing notes beneath bullet points, too, since the platform lets you switch in and out of document mode pretty easily.

  <strong>Step Three:</strong> Use jsfiddle.net. It&#8217;s lets you fiddle with HTML, CSS, and Javascript <em>all on the same web tab</em> and lets you see the results of your work with a single click.
