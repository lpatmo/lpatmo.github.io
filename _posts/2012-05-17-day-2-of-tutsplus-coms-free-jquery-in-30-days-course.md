<p>
  I started receiving Nettuts+&#8217;s 10-minute-ish video tutorials in jQuery a couple of days ago. Ran through the first lesson last week, but didn&#8217;t get a chance to open up the next one until today. (I have a pile in my inbox, now.)
</p>

<p>
  So far I like it! The videos are good refreshers for what I&#8217;ve read in textbooks so far, and they&#8217;re short and easy to understand (which is a huge plus, since they&#8217;re targeted at the absolute beginner.)
</p>

<div class="steps">
  Key takeaways from Day 2&#8217;s video:</p> 
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      $(document.ready(function() {
    </p>
    
    <p>
      });
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
    .. .can be written as:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      $(function () {
    </p>
    
    <p>
      });
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
    Also, the document-ready function is written so that the rest of the code on the page can load before the jQuery.
  </p>
