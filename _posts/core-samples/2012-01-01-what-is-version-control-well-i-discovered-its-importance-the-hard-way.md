<p>
  Last night I made the mistake of editing the files for a new WordPress child theme directly in Appearance -> Editor. It was going swimmingly until I added a few lines of CSS and changed some of the HTML in header.php. When I refreshed the page, the layout of the site had broken. And I backed up a few steps, but I couldn&#8217;t figure out what was wrong.
</p>

<p>
  <span class="steps">That was when I realized I really should be coding in a development environment, and definitely not on a live site.</span>
</p>

<p>
  I&#8217;ve heard that <a href="http://www.github.com">Github</a> is the most widely-used platform for open-sourced software development nowadays, so I&#8217;m going to put myself through some of its videos and start working with it. Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m hoping I&#8217;ll be able to learn:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    How to track changes and easily revert to an earlier version/backstep if I do something stupid
  </li>
  <li>
    How to push a particular code version to a live site
  </li>
</ul>
