  So. Here&#8217;s my history with text editors:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    I started with notepad++ on a PC. It was all right; I really enjoyed the ability to &#8220;run&#8221; my code in a web browser by clicking from the menu. This was before I understood much about file paths, and how it&#8217;s possible to view .html files without going through that user interface step.
  </li>
  <li>
    I tried out <a href="http://www.panic.com/coda" target="_blank">Coda</a>, but I didn&#8217;t really like its &#8220;preview&#8221; feature. It also cost $79, so I eventually settled on a free editor called <a href="http://www.aptana.com" target="_blank">Aptana</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    At the urging of an instructor at <a href="http://generalassemb.ly" target="_blank">General Assembly</a>, I installed <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2" target="_blank">Sublime</a>. I&#8217;ll occasionally get alerts requesting me to consider purchasing a license, but I love it so far! It&#8217;s #1: pretty; and #2: works well with the command-o and drag-drop-file-into-text-editor shortcuts (unlike Aptana); and #3: can open up to 2 or 3 file columns.
  </li>
</ul>

  Of course, two months later, I might very well be blogging about how much I love <a href="http://netbeans.org/" target="_blank">NetBeans</a>&#8230;. *grin*
