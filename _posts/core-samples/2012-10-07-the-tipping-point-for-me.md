  &#8230; was when I finally realized that I could *preview* HTML/CSS/Javascript files in my browser by typing in some variation of&#8230;
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    file:///Users/myname/Desktop/folder/folder/folder/index.html
  </p>

  &#8230;in a chrome or firefox browser.

  There was a time, scarcely less than a year ago, when I had absolutely no idea what to do when an online tutorial gave me a button to download a file package. Now, I can&#8217;t believe how <em>straightforward</em> the idea of HTML, CSS, and Javascript files working in sync are.
</p>

<p>
  <em>Essentially:</em>
</p>

<p>
  1) You start with the HTML file &#8212; usually named index.html or some variation thereof. You can make sure it starts with a <!doctype html> (go HTML5!), has <head></head> tags where you put your <title></title> and <meta> tags, has a <body>, and possibly some <div>&#8217;s and <p> tags.
</p>

<p>
  2) You create a CSS stylesheet (usually named style.css) and call it within the HTML document by writing <link href=&#8221;style.css&#8221; rel=&#8221;stylesheet&#8221; /> and putting it between the <head></head> tags in your HTML.
</p>

<p>
  3) Similarly, you can call your Javascript file (conventionally named script.js) by putting <script src=&#8221;script.js&#8221;></script> in your HTML &#8212; right before your </body> tag, so that the cool extra animation/behavioral effects you&#8217;re loading doesn&#8217;t interfere with your more essential content.
