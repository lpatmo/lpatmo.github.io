  If you&#8217;ve met me at all, you might realize that I love discussing web development and exchanging tutorials/resources and tips with other people. Naturally, when I heard a woman with a computer engineering background at a javascript meetup talk about picking up jQuery via a free Kindle e-book, my ears perked up.
</p>

<p>
  &#8220;Which e-book?&#8221; I said, curious.
</p>

<p>
  She told me to scroll down to the bottom of jQuery.com and click on one of the links there. Funny, in all time I&#8217;ve been using jQuery, I&#8217;d never paid much attention to the links at the bottom of <a href="http://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery.com</a> &#8212; but lo and behold, there it was: <a href="http://www.syncfusion.com/resources/techportal/ebooks/jquery?utm_medium=BizDev-jQuery.org0513" target="_blank">jQuery Succinctly by Cody Lindley, free downloadable e-book</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="http://www.thecodingdiaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-09-at-11.53.43-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-876" alt="jquery.com" src="http://www.thecodingdiaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-09-at-11.53.43-PM.png" width="524" height="225" /></a>
</p>

<p>
  Turns out this isn&#8217;t the only free e-book offered by <a href="http://www.syncfusion.com/resources/techportal/ebooks" target="_blank">Syncfusion</a>, the publisher; I quickly found the <a href="http://www.syncfusion.com/resources/techportal/ebooks" target="_blank">full list at http://www.syncfusion.com/resources/techportal/ebooks</a> and gleefully downloaded <a href="http://www.syncfusion.com/resources/techportal/ebooks/javascript" target="_blank">Javascript Succinctly</a> (because I wanted to review prototypal inheritance) and <a href="http://www.syncfusion.com/resources/techportal/ebooks/nodejs" target="_blank">Node.JS Succinctly</a> onto my Kindle as well.
</p>

<p>
  I should caveat that in general, I&#8217;m using other, more comprehensive resources to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects" target="_blank">review</a> Javascript <a href="http://javascript.info/tutorial/inheritance" target="_blank">objects</a> and <a href="http://nodeschool.io/" target="_blank">dip into NodeJS</a> &#8212; but when it comes to finding ways to spend my time efficiently during a subway commute, I&#8217;ve been struggling with scroll exhaustion, wifi outages and blank screens when I try to use my iPhone&#8217;s screen to load up developer docs on the web.
</p>

<p>
  Kindle presents such a nicer reading experience on the phone, and the best part was that I didn&#8217;t need wifi or spend a lot of money to read these books! Yay for productivity!
</p>

<p>
  Okay. My second revelation during the javascript meetup occurred when I realized that the only reason I&#8217;ve found learning programming in tandem with other people rather productive was because <strong><em>we asked each other questions all the</em><em> time</em>. </strong>
</p>

<p>
  For example:
</p>

<p>
  Person A: What is X?<br /> Person B: I think it has something to do with Y.<br /> Person A: Oh, really? *starts Googling*<br /> Person A: Ah, I see, this tutorial defines X as YZ and&#8230; wait, I don&#8217;t understand this part. What does that mean when it says Y is a function of XYZ?<br /> Person B: *starts reading too* I think it means that ZYX. Here, look at this explanation above from ABC.<br /> Person A: That makes sense now! They&#8217;re the same thing.<br /> Person B: Yeah, I understand it now too. Thanks for figuring it out with me.
</p>

<p>
  A commenter on one of my previous blog posts mentioned &#8220;spaced repetition quizzing&#8221; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Make-Stick-Peter-C-Brown-ebook/dp/B00JQ3FN7M/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1400835717&sr=1-1&keywords=make+it+stick+the+science+of+successful+learning" target="_blank">from this book</a> as a good way to make concepts stick, and I am intrigued; I am tempted to type out all my future notes in question/answer quiz format now.
</p>

<p>
  Of course, writing quiz questions for review isn&#8217;t exactly a novel concept; I didn&#8217;t go through sixteen years of schooling without writing out questions for Spanish class or testing myself using flashcards.
</p>

<p>
  On the other hand, I haven&#8217;t approached note-taking in <em>programming</em> the same way, because I&#8217;ve been learning on the job &#8212; i.e. in a non-academic setting. Maybe it&#8217;s time to start.
</p>

<p>
  To be continued!
