<p>
  <strong>Stage 1 (beginner level):</strong> Panic and call your hosting company.
</p>

<p>
  Because you&#8217;re a beginner. And for some reason, English in technical jargon just Does Not Compute. To you, &#8220;Error on line 41 in askdjf2fj-sldfkjsfaf.php&#8221; means &#8220;OMG I JUST BROKE THE SITE HOW DO I REVERSE IT.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Stage 2 (after a few months):</strong> Google.
</p>

<p>
  After a few months, you start to realize that the hey, the error messages actually contain meaning, and other people have encountered similar errors! If you can&#8217;t undo what you just did to get the error, you copy/paste it into a search engine. Half the time you find nothing helpful; the other half of the time, you find something, but don&#8217;t understand enough to find the Stackoverflow solution helpful.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Stage 3 (after a few months more):</strong> You read the error like it&#8217;s English.
</p>

<p>
  &#8230; And you understand enough to decipher the meaningless jargon the screen sometimes spits out from <em>what&#8217;s really important</em>. Then you go ahead and find the right file and fix the corresponding error. Sometimes the instructions for what to do next (like when there&#8217;s a merge conflict in git) are output directly into the console, yay!
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Stage 4 (a year later): </strong>
</p>

<p>
  You know when to attempt a quick fix, when to google, when to ask for help from a co-worker, and when to say &#8220;to heck with it&#8221; and restart your server and rebuild your database. You don&#8217;t panic anymore, because you know that somehow, somewhere, at some point it will be fixed.
</p>

<p>
  Okay, this is a somewhat tongue-in-cheek story of what I&#8217;ve been through with error messages. I&#8217;m learning Django now, and suddenly I&#8217;m looking forward to a lot more server-issue-related messages. I still don&#8217;t like them, but I panic a lot less now.
</p>

<p>
  And I&#8217;ve stopped calling my hosting company.*
</p>

<p>
  *Yes, I am embarrassed to admit this did happen when I messed up some PHP on my first ever self-hosted WordPress site. <em>This was before I even knew CSS, okay? Okay.</em>
