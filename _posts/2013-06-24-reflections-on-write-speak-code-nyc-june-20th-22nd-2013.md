<p>
  I landed at Write-Speak-Code just a couple of weeks after AdaCamp, and boy, it did not disappoint. The group was slightly smaller than AdaCamp&#8217;s and more training-focused. I had to miss the second day (Speak day!) to go to my brother&#8217;s high school graduation, but to make up for it, I took a lot of notes on Days One and Three.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Highlights of the conference:</strong>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The <a href="http://www.theopedproject.org/">Op-Ed Project&#8217;s</a> training that encouraged participants to write and submit newspaper op-eds
  </li>
  <li>
    Pondering on what makes a person a &#8220;resource&#8221; vs. an &#8220;expert.&#8221; Wait &#8212; although many women are hesitant to call themselves experts, they may be one and the same! I particularly liked the idea about how &#8220;keeping your knowledge to yourself &#8212; no matter how &#8220;unexpert&#8221; you are &#8212; can be selfishness.&#8221;
  </li>
  <li>
    Learning about the different types of licenses &#8212; FreeBSD vs. MIT License vs. GNU vs. CopyLeft, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    Resources for finding open-source projects: <a href="http://bit.ly/FindingOSSProjects">http://bit.ly/FindingOSSProjects</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Learning about SQL injection, password storage, and Cross Site Scripting (XSS) from a security expert
  </li>
  <li>
    Hearing from many amazing women personally about their open source contributors, technology book deals, and conference speaking activities
  </li>
</ul>
