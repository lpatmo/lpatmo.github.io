  I am pretty sure I am a better developer than I was 100 days ago, but some days I look at my coworkers&#8217; commits, or think about all the frameworks I still don&#8217;t have great experience with, and wonder about the actual rate of my progress.
</p>

<p>
  Wouldn&#8217;t it be cool if more people shared their small knowledge victories, and were able to point back to those archives and say &#8220;this is what I&#8217;ve learned&#8221;?
</p>

<p>
  So here&#8217;s the challenge:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Write a short blog post (or tweet/instagram) about <i>ONE NEW THING</i> you learn that&#8217;s code-related &#8212; <em>no matter how small</em> &#8212; each day. It could be a code snippet. It could be a summary of a stackoverflow answer. It could be a sentence referencing an &#8220;aha!&#8221; moment. #100daysofcode
  </li>
  <li>
    Do it for 100 days.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
