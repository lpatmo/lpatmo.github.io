<p>
  I went to an API hackathon, and ended up watching a 19-year-old college freshman <em>dominate</em> Photoshop CS6 with a tablet. After that, I couldn&#8217;t help but take out my 30-day trial of CS6 too. As a long-time user of Microsoft PowerPoint, web apps like PicMonkey, and other tools where <em>clicking on an item selected it</em>, figuring out how to play around with layers was the biggest learning curve. But after that? Wow.
</p>

<p>
  I was honestly pretty excited to finally unveil the mystery of how transparent graphics were created. Hurrah for magic eraser tools:
</p>

</p>

<p>
  I also discovered that once you get through the initial curves of realizing that keyboard shortcuts are your friend and that layers are <em>not</em> selected by clicking on the canvas, Google really *is* your friend.
</p>

<p>
  I&#8217;m sure I still have much to learn, but in any case, these basics I&#8217;ve googled have been really helpful in getting me to wield Photoshop as easily as I did Microsoft Paint:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    command-[ and command-] moves layers backward and forward, respectively (you can also manually drag them up and down) (
  </li>
  <li>
    command-T lets you adjust the size of a layer after you select it
  </li>
  <li>
    If you *do* want to select a layer that you point to right on the canvas, you have to hit command-click
  </li>
  <li>
    control-option adjusts the size of your circular brush tool
  </li>
  <li>
    It *is* possible to change the canvas size in the middle of editing! Simply go to image -> canvas size. You can also adjust the dimensions of an image by going to image -> image size.
  </li>
  <li>
    Press &#8216;b&#8217; for the brush shortcut, &#8216;v&#8217; for the view shortcut, &#8216;c&#8217; to crop the entire canvas, &#8216;t&#8217; to write a block of text, etc.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  I&#8217;m probably going to read through a book about Photoshop soon &#8212; but for now, I&#8217;m happy to be comfortable with knowing enough to create some of my own custom graphics.
